When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to have an online backup of your work or when you want to work on a project using multiple computers.

###

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because some changes require multiple commits to be fully functional and maybe you don't like making your half-baked code public.
